# Source-Code-Management-Project-2

I started by cloning my GitHub repository

Then I added the form.html and style.css files given to me by my client

Then I committed my changes

Then I push the initial commit to the remote repository

Then my client requested that I make some updates to the HTML file and style file

After I made the changes, I staged, committed, and updated files

Then I push my latest changes to the remote repository

After working on several features and fixes, I viewed the Git history to check all the changes I had made

My client wants to experiment with adding a CAPTCHA feature to the form. I created a new branch named feature-add-captcha and switched to it.

Then, I make the necessary changes for the CAPTCHA feature, I stage and commit them

Then, I merge the changes back into the main branch

After merging, I push the updated main branch to the remote repository
